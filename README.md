# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Peer-graded Assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course from Coursera
This project was developed so that a tidy dataset would be created from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set that is made available in the following website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
## Files 
*CodeBook.md it's the codebook that describes the variables, that were created from every step 
*run_analysis.R performs the 5 (five) requirements that were previously defined in the project instructions:
	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
	5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
*tidydata.txt is the exported data that is resultant of running the run_analysis R Script
